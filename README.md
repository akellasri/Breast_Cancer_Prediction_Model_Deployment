# To predict whether the Breast Cancer is benign or malignant, a Machine Learning Model is built On Web Application Using the Breast Cancer Wisconson Data Set.

### Problem Statement:

#### The main objective is to identify the right features that are helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.

To achieve this, I have created different steps to build the final model.

1. Define and Understand the Problem Statement
2. Data Gathering or Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning 
4. EDA like Feature Scaling, Feature Selection
5. Data Modeling
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Deployment (done using Heroku Cloud Application)
